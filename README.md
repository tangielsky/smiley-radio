Webradio for your garage or room

****************************************************
Welcome to my webradio project
You'll find here the Lazarus (Freepascal) code for the Raspberry Pi. 
More information is available in the following blog posts:

Part 1: Garage Internet Radio with Raspberry Pi (https://techpluscode.de/werkstatt-radio-mit-raspberry-pi)
Part 2: Electronic and Housing (https://techpluscode.de/raspberry-pi-werkstatt-radio-elektronik-und-gehaeuse/)
Part 3: Software, GPIO and Webradio (https://techpluscode.de/werkstatt-radio-software-gpio-und-webradio)


If you are using the current version of BASS, you need the correct version of the library “libbass.so”. You can find it in the “hardfp” folder. Copy the file into the development folder of your Lazarus project. Then it works with the current BASS version.

You can find the download at:

This also applies if there are problems with the current Raspbian version (Kernel 4.19) and the Lazarus Smiley project does not start. Exchange “libbass.so” – done!


Sorry - the blog posts are in German - but you can select your language in the Google translator toolbox on the right-side-menu.

Have fun with the player!
